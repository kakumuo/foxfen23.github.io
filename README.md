# TODO
### Fixes
- ~~section not underlining after changing theme once~~ [use 'useRef' instead of 'createRef', resets on repaint]
- ~~look at caption leading of top of page~~ [negate y pos when out of bounds]
- ~~react router not working w/ github pages~~ [resolved through: https://medium.com/@bennirus/deploying-a-create-react-app-with-routing-to-github-pages-f386b6ce84c2]
### Future
- reactive
- fill with data
- configure colors
### Brainstorming
- light and dark theme w/ physics based light switch cord
- List projects from github, pull through API
- List resume from google docs, pull through API
